# Requirements

## General UI
### Wireframe: (https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/2260e2cb3112370)
* Use header from other pages (header.html)
* Use footer from other pages (footer.html)
* Use same cards from index.html (and possibly turn this into its own html template?)

### Functionality
* Possibly have a "featured app" similar to GPlay?
* Allow devs to link (or unlink) their dev accounts on XDA Forums.


### Other
* Need to remove the search filter, as well as the "Dev" chip
